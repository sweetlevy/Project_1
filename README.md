This application was created for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.

The purpose of this application is to be an Unprotected Landscape WatchList for natural areas near
urban and suburban developments in the United States that are not protected under federal, state or local
land-use laws. The goal of the application/website is to have concerned citizens be able to publicize the
often unknown unprotected status of these natural areas or landscapes so that they can be monitored against
threats of impending developments.

Visitors to the application/website will be able to view the issues index page/home page
of the application/website and to have the option to sign up to become a user of the application/website.  
After visitors sign up and become users of the application, they will be able to add new unprotected
landscape sites to the application/website.  When logged in as users, they will also be able to edit
and delete the landscape site issue they created.  The users will then be able to logout of the
application/website and will be able to login to the application/website on their next visit.
