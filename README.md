This application was created for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.
This application is in development and the information on it is not to be relied
upon for real unprotected landscape issues as some issues have been made up by me for
purposes of the development and testing of this application.

********************************************************************************

The purpose of this application is to be an Unprotected Landscape WatchList for natural areas near
urban and suburban developments in the United States that are not protected under federal, state or local
land-use laws. The goal of the application/website is to have concerned citizens be able to publicize the
often unknown unprotected status of these natural areas or landscapes so that they can be monitored against
threats of impending developments.

Visitors to the application/website will be able to view the issues index page/home page
of the application/website and to have the option to sign up to become a user of the application/website.  
After visitors sign up and become users of the application, they will be able to add new unprotected
landscape sites to the application/website.  When logged in as users, they will also be able to edit
and delete the landscape site issue that they created.  The users will then be able to logout of the
application/website and will be able to login to the application/website on their next visit.  Users who
signed up for an account will also be able to delete their user account.  At this time, the issue that
they created will not be deleted when their user account is deleted and no other user will be able to
edit and delete the issue once the user that created it no longer exists.  In the future, the goal is to have
an administrator user be able to edit and delete all issues created by all users for the purpose of needing to
edit and delete an issue created by a user that no longer exists or has deleted their account.
